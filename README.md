## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This mod adds a new set of Mage items scattered through the game. Please read <a href="https://spellholdstudios.github.io/readmes/sotm-spoilers.txt">sotm-spoilers.txt</a> for details.

Once you gather all the items, the one who equip them all gain an exceptional bonus. Also, if you have all items, you will meet someone in the Pocket Plane who will want to speak with you...

Note: If you choose the original overpowered items you will only end up with 7 items instead of 9, no cape nor ring.  


<details><summary><ins>Minor spoiler for lazy players!</ins></summary>
<p><br>
This mod adds the Stuff of the Magi set to the following creatures:

- Robe: Vongoethe.</br>
- Amulet: Demogorgon.</br>
- Boots: Kangaxx.</br>
- Staff: Mage (Layene) in Twisted Rune.</br>
- Bracers: Firkraag.</br>

</details><br>

**Never forget:** All the original work was done by Victor Straffe at <a href="https://sorcerers.net/Games/BG2/index_mods_hosted_items_spells2.php">Sorcerer's Place</a>. Kevmus updated it to WeiDU, added the more balanced items, and "bugfixed like a madman".

<hr>

>Although it is not required for the Stuff of the Magi mod to function properly, classical game players are strongly recommended to download and install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.<br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-stuffofthemagi.exe`**, un-install all previously installed main component and delete the :file_folder: **stuffofthemagi** folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

The Stuff of the Magi mod for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: stuffofthemagi folder and a setup-stuffofthemagi.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-stuffofthemagi.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-stuffofthemagi.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Mac OS X

The Stuff of the Magi mod for Mac OS X is distributed is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: stuffofthemagi folder, setup-stuffofthemagi and setup-stuffofthemagi.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-stuffofthemagi.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-stuffofthemagi.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

The Stuff of the Magi mod for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy weidU and weinstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, **cd** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`weinstall setup-stuffofthemagi`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine BGMain.exe`** (or **`wine Baldur.exe`** for EE games) and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-stuffofthemagi --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>


<hr>


## <a name="components" id="components"></a>Components

As of v6.0.0, the installer splits main component into four sub components, letting the player decide which one he/she wants to install.  
The number of each is the component DESIGNATED number which gives it a fixed install position and allows automated installers to specify component choices.<br />

## 

**0. Use new, less cheesy items AND Add them to creatures' equipment** (recommended)  
**1. Use new, less cheesy items AND Add them to creatures' inventory**  
**2. Use original, overpowered items AND Add them to creatures' equipment**  
**3. Use original, overpowered items AND Add them to creatures' inventory**  

## 

:warning: Please note that the recommended installation options are "*Use new, less cheesy items*" and "*Add them to creatures' equipment*".<br>
If you choose "*Add items to creatures' equipment*", enemies will use these items against you, while "*Add items to creature's inventory*" option won't change difficulty of fights.
